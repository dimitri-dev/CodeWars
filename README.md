# CodeWars
 This is a collection of solutions from my own personal CodeWars journey.

## What is CodeWars
 CodeWars is a website through which you can solve algorithmic problems and "achieve code mastery".
 
 Everyone is free to participate by registering at [CodeWars](https://codewars.com).

## Language (Why C++)
 Originally this repository is meant to be my training for a competitive programming competition, so it is written in C++ (originally). In the future, I may decide to rework the solutions, or even start my C# journey on CodeWars (or even other langugages) - but if I do so, I'll open a new repository.
